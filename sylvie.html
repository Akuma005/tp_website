                    <p>I wanted to tell you alot of things, yesterday I was reading our chats from when we started dating. And reading all our chats from the starting, it was nostalgic and funny because I used to be soo dumb but you know It's like a dream for me to date an angel like you, when I was not feeling good you've always helped me alot, and I will always be here for you, if you need any help I will be there for you. And you know when we first met I was scared, I've never talked to any girl in my life until I got into jake's server, I met you and many amazing people and to be really honest I've really liked you from the start, and I will continue to love you. And as for me these days I have been living my life in confusion, because of many problems and thoughts that come in my mind. And you know I've always missed talking to you, But I'll wait for you until your exams are over then we can finally talk :D.

                    <p>I am always thinking about you, and I am constantly thinking about a future where I can give you everythng you want. I also bought gifts for you, tho I am confused how should I give it to you like I am worried to give it through mail, I've thought that when we meet irl I'll give it to you. btw I might come to meet you next year :D, I've really wanted to talk to you on vc too maybe after your boards we can do it. ohh yea and if you're worried about my health don't be worried about it I'll always come back fine. by the way how are your studies going, ohh and are you well? btw Best of luck for you exams, I will be praying so that u pass.</p>
